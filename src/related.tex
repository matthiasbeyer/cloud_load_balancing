Previous work compared distributed load balancing algorithms for cloud computing
environments.
Honeybee Foraging Behaviour as well as Biased Random Sampling and Active
Clustering were compared by M. Randles et al. in \cite{aCompDLBA}.
It is shown that current commercial centralized offerings won't be as scalable
as demand.

H. Bryhni et al. compared load balancing techniques in a web environment.
They explicitely compare the rotating name-server method to other methods used
in web cluster environments, such as remapping requests and responses in the
network \cite{aCompLBAforWeb}.
They see remapping as viable solution for load balancing.
They also argue that load balancing has some positive side effects regarding to
fault tolerance.
Finally, they conclude that a \ac{RR} algorithm is feasible for its simple
implementation and good load sharing.
