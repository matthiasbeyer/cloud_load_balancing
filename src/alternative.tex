The following chapter describes some lesser-known load balancing algorithm and
their general approach.

\subsection{Honey bee inspired load balancing}

In \cite{honeybee}, Dhinesh Babu L.D. and P. Venkata Krishna propose a honey bee
behaviour inspired load balancing algorithm.
This algorithm takes priority of tasks into account and works well for
heterogeneous cloud environments.
It also reduces the waiting time of tasks in the queues on the worker instances.

The Honey bee inspired load balancing algorithm is, as the name tells, based on
the foraging behaviour of honey bees and the \ac{ABC} as proposed by
N. Karaboga \cite{honeybee}.

Dhinesh Babu L.D. and P. Venkata Krishna illustrate that their algorithm
improves average execution time and reduce waiting time of queued tasks.

\subsection{Resource Reservation for Web Services Load Balancing}

A. Nakai, E. Madeira and L. E. Buzato outline a server-based load balancing
policy for worldwide distributed web servers in \cite{nakai}.

Compared to known solutions (\ac{RR}, \ac{RR-AA}, \ac{SL} and \ac{LU} as
implemented in the ``HAProxy'' open source load balancing solution), their
algorithm presented better performance due to the fact that their algorithm
prevented overloading rather than rebalancing work if overloading occurs.
