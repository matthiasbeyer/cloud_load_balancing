The following chapter describes some lesser-known load balancing algorithm and
their general approach.

\subsection{Honey bee inspired load balancing}

In \cite{honeybee}, Dhinesh Babu L.D. and P. Venkata Krishna propose a honey bee
behaviour inspired load balancing algorithm.
This algorithm takes priority of tasks into account and works well for
heterogeneous cloud environments.
It also reduces the waiting time of tasks in the queues on the worker instances.

The Honey bee inspired load balancing algorithm is, as the name tells, based on
the foraging behaviour of honey bees and the \ac{ABC} as proposed by
N. Karaboga \cite{honeybee}.

Dhinesh Babu L.D. and P. Venkata Krishna illustrate that their algorithm
improves average execution time and reduce waiting time of queued tasks.
