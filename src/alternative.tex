In \cite{honeybee}, Dhinesh Babu L.D. and P. Venkata Krishna propose a honeybee
behaviour inspired load balancing algorithm.
This algorithm takes the priority of tasks into account and works well for
heterogeneous cloud environments.
It also reduces the waiting time of tasks in the queues on the worker instances.

The honeybee inspired load balancing algorithm is, as the name tells, based on
the foraging behaviour of honey bees and the \ac{ABC} as proposed by
N. Karaboga \cite{honeybee}.

Dhinesh Babu L.D. and P. Venkata Krishna illustrate that their algorithm
improves average execution time and reduce waiting time of queued tasks.

A. Nakai, E. Madeira and L. E. Buzato outline a server-based load balancing
policy for worldwide distributed web servers in \cite{nakai}.

Compared to known solutions (\ac{RR}, \ac{RR-AA}, \ac{SL} and \ac{LU} as
implemented in the ``HAProxy'' open source load balancing solution), their
algorithm presented better performance due to the fact that it
prevented overloading rather than rebalancing work if overloading occurs.

In \cite{simulOfLBA} M. E. Soklic compares a diffusive load balancing algorithm
to common algorithms such as \ac{RR} and \ac{JSQ} in a distributed environment.
It is shown that diffusive load balancing is more effective than \ac{RR} or
static load balancing.
