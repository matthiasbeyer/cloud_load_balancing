``Load balancing'' itself is a board terminus used to describe the act of
distributing workload over a set of workers to increase the overall throughput.
In large scale computing environments such as ``the cloud'', load balancing can
be and is used to normalize workload of tasks and requests that are issued by
clients over the network.
Load balancing solutions can be categorized for example by implemented balancing
algorithm and network layer they operate on.

A \ac{LBA} must be able to distribute load as evenly as possible
over a set of nodes.
Additionally a \ac{LBA} itself must hold several properties,
such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reproducible results
    \item Statelessness
    \item Speed
    \item Reliability
\end{itemize}
Other desireable features are dynamic spawning of worker instances or
hot-plugging of instances, generation of statistics and possibly even on-line
upgrading.

The following chapters will explain why these properties are feasible.
