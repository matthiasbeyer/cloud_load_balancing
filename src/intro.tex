In large scale computing environments such as ``the cloud'', load balancing can
be used to normalize workload of tasks and requests that are issued by
clients over the network \cite{alakeel2010guide} or distributing virtual machines
over a set of physical machines.
With load balancing it is possible to distribute workload over a set of workers
to either increase the overall capacity, which is called horizontal scaling,
or improve resiliency \cite{areYouLoadBalancingWrong}, \cite{aTaxonomyAndSurv},
\cite{cloudLBTech}.

The following chapters will describe several load balancing algorithms, outline
their properties and show problems that emerge from the problem of load
balancing in cloud and distributed systems.
