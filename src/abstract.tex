Cloud computing is one of the big challenges in the computer science world of
our time.
On demand access to computing power and storage resources
as offered by cloud computing providers result in new challenges in resource-
and capacity management.
Cloud hosting providers implement intelligent load-balancing algorithms to
automatically
distribute load over a large network of physical machines to serve demands in
the best possible way and guarantee a maximum of availability of resources.

In this paper, we give a short introduction to load balancing in general and
discuss different known load balancing algorithms.
We compare their behaviour by applying each algorithm to a given problem.
Additionally, we shortly introduce some lesser known and more complex
algorithms.
