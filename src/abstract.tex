Cloud computing is one of the big challenges in the computer science world of
our time.
On demand access to computing power and storage resources
as offered by cloud computing providers result in new challenges in resource-
and capacity management.
Cloud hosting providers implement intelligent load-balancing algorithms to
automatically
distribute load over a large network of physical machines to serve demands in
the best possible way and guarantee a maximum of availability of resources.

In this paper we discuss the challenges that emerge from cloud load balancing,
as well as several approaches to load balancing in cloud environments.
We discuss applicability of several algorithms and challenges in
their implementation.

\textbf{Keywords:} Algorithm, Load Balancing
