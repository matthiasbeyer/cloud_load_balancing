% algorithms chapter
\subsection{Input Data}

% Nodes + their system data (CPU, RAM, NETWORK connection)
% Kind of request (CPU intensive, RAM intensiev, network intensive)
% Kind of infrastructure: homogenuouse vs. heterogenuouse

\subsection{Properties of \ac{LBA}}
% * Spreading load evenly
% * Reproducible results
% * Statelessness
% * Speed
% * Reliability
%
% All related:
% * statistics
% * dynamic/automatic spawning of instances
% * hot-plugging instances
% * On-line upgrading
