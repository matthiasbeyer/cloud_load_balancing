In the following chapter, we focus on how load balancing algorithms must work.
In the first section we describe what input data must be provided for the
algorithm to work.
In the next section we describe the properties of such an algorithm.
Finally, we compare some simple load balancing algorithms to display their
behaviour.

\subsection{Input Data}
\label{sec:algo:input}

% Nodes + their system data (CPU, RAM, NETWORK connection)
% Kind of request (CPU intensive, RAM intensiev, network intensive)
% Kind of infrastructure: homogenuouse vs. heterogenuouse

\subsection{Properties of \ac{LBA}}
\label{sec:algo:prop}
% * Spreading load evenly
% * Reproducible results
% * Statelessness
% * Speed
% * Reliability
%
% All related:
% * statistics
% * dynamic/automatic spawning of instances
% * hot-plugging instances
% * On-line upgrading

\subsection{Comparation of algorithms}
\label{sec:algo:comp}
