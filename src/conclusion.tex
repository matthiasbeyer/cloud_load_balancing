In this paper, we described some of the known load balancing algorithms but also
listed some of the lesser known.
We showed a simple comparison of known load balancing algorithms and their
behaviour in a non-distributed environment by implementing them in the Rust
programming language and feeding them with artificial random data.

Though load balancing has been adressed by various parties, the $NP$-hard
problem of distributing load among a set of worker instances remains
interesting.
